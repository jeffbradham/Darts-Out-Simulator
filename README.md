# Darts-Out-Simulator
Currently just have a script that prints all possible outs...hoping to grow the project to include accuracy/precision inputs to account for alternate paths when a dart strays.  Maybe even apply AI.

Still working out the Project Goals and Priorities...lets gather some ideas and thoughts here:

Will need to model the dimensions/coordinates of the areas of the board..here is an example that starts that and also includes GUI feedback
